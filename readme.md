# Bootflow; A Modern Frontend Development Starter Kit With Faster Build Speeds

Hi, I'm Bootflow. I am a frontend starter kit to get you started with your next awesome project in no time. I orchestrate modern tools like gulp, webpack, SCSS, ES2016+ support via Babel, CSS Sprites generation, Image optimization, assets minification and more.

## Let's get you started quickly!

```
1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/vineet05/bootflow

2. cd into directory bootflow

3. run `npm install` to install all dependencies

4. Run `npm run serve` and I will start a development server and watch your assets for changes.

Happy Hacking :)

```

## My Dependencies?

Yeah! to start working I would require [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and a global installation of [gulp 4.x](http://gulpjs.com/) on your development machine.

```
# Install gulp globally
npm install -g gulp

# Make sure you have correct Gulp version
gulp --version
```

## Development & Production Builds

```
Use DEV_MODE in gulpconfig.json to switch between development & production mode.
True sets the DEV_MODE to development, false sets it to production.

Run: npm run build
It creates a dist folder to distribute your production application.

Run: npm run dist
It creates a dev-dist folder to redistribute your project with all development files.

```

## For Advanced Configuration

```
=> Gulpconfig.json holds the configuration object for your gulp.

=> webpack.config.json holds the webpack config for your project.

```
